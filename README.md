# Sustainable Storyboards
## Problem statement
EcoThreads is a well-established Indian apparel brand, known for its traditional and contemporary clothing. With 25 years in the textile industry, the company has built a strong reputation for quality craftsmanship and innovation. It has successfully tapped into both domestic and international markets, with a presence in over 50 cities in India and export contracts with retailers in 10 countries. With a yearly revenue of INR 500 crores and profits reinvested into innovation, the company is financially capable of diversifying into new markets. The company boasts a skilled workforce of over 5,000 employees, including designers, textile experts, and sustainability advocates. It has already invested in state-of-the-art production technology and is exploring the use of eco-friendly fabrics like bamboo fiber and organic cotton. 
 
While EcoThreads is confident in its potential to venture into sustainable fashion, it needs to analyze the global market trends and consumer preferences carefully. The company must decide which specific areas of sustainable fashion to focus on, such as 
- Assessing which materials should EcoThreads prioritize in its product line to resonate with environmentally conscious consumers? 
- Which regions and demographic groups offer the greatest opportunity for Eco Threads to tap into the growing demand for sustainable fashion? 
- Which areas should EcoThreads invest in to maximize its market share in the sustainable fashion industry?
